## About The Project

Currently, I'm taking "The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)" by Andrew Mead to continue my exciting journey learning Node.Js after finishing "The Complete Node.js Course" by Mosh Hamedani, you can check what I've built during that course right there https://github.com/mohieey/vidly_nodejs_course.
Throughout this course, I'm going to build 4 projects, and this is the first one!
It's a simple Node.Js app to manage notes and store them in a JSON file, seems simple, huh ðŸ˜…?
It's just the beginning and more complex apps are coming, stay tuned!
